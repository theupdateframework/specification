Versioning
----------

The TUF specification uses `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/>`_
(semver) for its version numbers, and a gitflow-based release management:

- The 'master' branch of this repository always points to the latest stable
  version of the specification.
- The 'draft' branch of this repository always points to the latest development
  version of the specification and must always be based off of the latest
  'master' branch.
- Contributors must submit changes as pull requests against these branches,
  depending on the type of the change (see semver rules).
- For patch-type changes, pull requests may be submitted directly against the
  'master' branch.
- For major- and minor-type changes, pull requests must be submitted against
  the 'draft' branch.
- Maintainers may, from time to time, decide that the 'draft' branch is ready
  for a new major or minor release, and submit a pull request from 'draft'
  against 'master'.
- Before merging a branch with 'master' the 'last modified date' and 'version'
  in the specification header must be bumped.
- Merges with 'master' that originate from the 'draft' branch must bump either
  the major or minor version number.
- Merges with 'master' that originate from any other branch must bump the patch
  version number.
- Merges with 'master' must be followed by a git tag for the new version
  number.
- Merges with 'master' must be followed by a rebase of 'draft' onto 'master'.

Keep track of new TUF releases
------------------------------

There's a reusable workflow that can be used by projects to keep track of
new TUF specification releases. It automatically opens an issue to notify
the project in case the released version is different from what the project
states it supports.

The workflow, along with an example of how to use it, can be found at - `.github/workflows/check-latest-spec-version.yml
</.github/workflows/check-latest-spec-version.yml>`_.
